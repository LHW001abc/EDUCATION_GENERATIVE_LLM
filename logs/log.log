2023-09-19 09:03:55,065 - INFO - The top 4 chunks are considered to answer the user's query.
2023-09-19 09:04:01,050 - INFO - The returned answer is: Stemmatization is the process of reducing words to their word stem, base, or root form. It is a technique used in text preprocessing in natural language processing (NLP). Stemming helps to normalize words and reduce inflectional forms to a common base form. Unlike lemmatization, which uses lexical knowledge bases to get the correct base forms of words, stemming simply chops off inflections.

2023-09-19 09:04:44,617 - INFO - The returned answer is: Based on the provided documentation, the three key concepts covered are:

1. NLP Terminology:
- Corpus: collection of text (e.g., Yelp Reviews, Wikipedia)
- Syntax: the grammatical structure of the text
- Semantics: the meaning of text
- Tokenization: splitting longer pieces of texts into smaller pieces (tokens)
- Vocabulary: list of unique words
- Stop words: commonly used words that don't contribute a lot to the overall meaning (e.g., "the", "a", "an", "is", "are")

2. Text Preprocessing Techniques:
- Practice basic preprocessing techniques on text data

3. Learning Objectives:
- Introduction to NLP terminology
- Diving into NLP and text preprocessing techniques

If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

- Lemmatization reduces inflectional forms to a common base form, known as the lemma. 

Stemming and lemmatization are similar in that they both aim to reduce words to a common form, but there is a slight difference in how they achieve this:

- Stemming chops off inflections from words, while lemmatization uses lexical knowledge bases to obtain the correct base forms.

2023-09-19 21:57:47,280 - INFO - The returned answer is: Stemming and lemmatization are both text normalization techniques used in natural language processing (NLP). Here's the difference between them:

- Stemming: Stemming reduces words to their word stem, base, or root form. It aims to remove inflections from words by chopping off the ends of words. For example, the word "running" would be stemmed to "run". Stemming does not guarantee that the resulting stem is an actual word in the language.

- Lemmatization: Lemmatization also reduces words to a common base form, but it uses lexical knowledge bases to find the correct base form of a word. Unlike stemming, lemmatization considers the context and meaning of the word before reducing it. For example, the word "running" would be lemmatized to "run" because it recognizes that "running" is the present participle form of the verb "run". Lemmatization ensures that the resulting base form is a valid word in the language.

- Lemmatization also reduces inflectional forms to a common base form, but it uses lexical knowledge bases to get the correct base forms of words instead of simply chopping off inflections.

In summary, the main difference between stemming and lemmatization is that stemming does not take into account the context or meaning of the word, while lemmatization uses lexical knowledge to determine the base form of a word.

- Stemming: Stemming involves reducing words to their word stem, base, or root form. It chops off inflections from words to get to the base form. Stemming does not consider the context of the word and may result in non-dictionary words. For example:
  - Original word: running
  - Stemmed word: run

- Lemmatization: Lemmatization is similar to stemming but reduces inflectional forms to a common base form called the lemma. It uses lexical knowledge bases to determine the correct base form of a word, considering its context. For example:
  - Original word: running
  - Lemmatized word: run

Applied Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a field that involves the use of techniques and tools to analyze and understand human language. It includes processes such as text preprocessing, syntactic parsing, and semantic analysis. NLP helps in extracting meaning and structure from text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and creating a vocabulary of unique words. It allows for the analysis of large text collections, such as Yelp reviews or Wikipedia, and helps in uncovering patterns and insights from textual data.

- NLP terminology includes concepts such as corpus, syntax, semantics, tokenization, vocabulary, and stop words.
- Corpus refers to a collection of text, such as Yelp reviews or Wikipedia.
- Syntax is the grammatical structure of the text.
- Syntactic parsing is the process of analyzing natural language using grammatical rules.
- Semantics refers to the meaning of text.
- Tokenization is the process of splitting longer pieces of text into smaller pieces called tokens, such as splitting a sentence into words.
- Vocabulary is a list of unique words.
- Stop words are commonly used words that do not contribute much to the overall meaning, such as "the," "a," "an," "is," and "are."

2023-09-22 12:33:13,040 - INFO - The returned answer is: Stemming and lemmatization are two different techniques used in text preprocessing. Here is the difference between them:

Stemming:
- Reduces words to their word stem, base, or root form.
- Example: The word "running" is stemmed to "run".

Lemmatization:
- Reduces inflectional forms of words to a common base form called the lemma.
- Uses lexical knowledge bases to determine the correct base form of words.
- Example: The word "running" is lemmatized to "run".

- Stemming: Stemming reduces words to their word stem, base, or root form. It aims to remove inflections from words by chopping off the ends. For example:
   - Original word: running
   - Stemmed word: run

- Lemmatization: Lemmatization also reduces words to a common base form, but it uses lexical knowledge bases to find the correct base form of words. It doesn't simply chop off inflections like stemming. For example:
   - Original word: running
   - Lemmatized word: run
